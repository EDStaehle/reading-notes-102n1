## Explain Growth Mindset

- Growth mindset is being able to understand that even if you are not good at something when you first start it. You can become good at it as long as you put your heart into it.
- growth mindset is a mindset where you never give up. 
- Growth mindset is looking at someone else's success and asking yourself how you can achieve that. 

## My reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset. 

1. You learn as much from your failures as you do from success.
2. If it was easy everyone would do it.
3. The only difference between someone who succeeds and someone who doesn't is the letter "t"
